Last weekend I used the long weekend (constitution's day and immaculate conception) to do a little trip with my fellow EVS friend Ben from France to visit the dwarf state in the middle of the Pyrenees. Andorra.

## Day 1: 

### Bus journey

My journey started early in the morning at 6:15 AM where I had to convince myself with standing up, packing my things and eating my breakfast. In fashionable German manners, I arrived at the bus station 20 minutes too early so I decided to sit on a bench at the bus station and wait until my bus was displayed. As I was waiting I saw some people grouping in front of my bus talking to the conductor so I thought they would at some point just enter the bus. But against my expectations, they were just chatting and the conductor then drove off in a matter of seconds without anyone inside. I didn't hesitate for too long and immediately drove off to Barcelona to catch the next connection.

Arriving in Barcelona at 10:20 with 10 minutes to catch my bus at the bus station across the street made me really happy by then. From there on my approximately 3h trip from Barcelona to Andorra La Vella started.

Unfortunately, I wasn't the only one who wanted to use the long weekend for a trip to Andorra. As we came near to the border we started getting into a traffic jam and the planned three-hour bus ride took me four hours instead. But at least the Andorran police was happy because not even two minutes after we crossed the border the police came inside our bus and searched with the help of a dog for drug smugglers.

### Arrival

My first impressions of Andorra reminded me of Austria. The Spanish side looks a lot like the 'Großwalsertal', small streets and mountains right next to you. The French side reminded me more of Tyrol. Valleys with high mountains and small cities.

It was around half past two when I finally arrived at the bus station in Andorra. I then met up with Ben and we decided to get some food and plan what we want to do. Fully saturated we then decided to take a little walk around the city that was definitely in a christmas mood already. After that, we decided to go to the hostel to check-in and take a short break.

Ben, like the crazy man he is, wanted to go night hiking for 6 hours at 5° to [Pic del Port Vell](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Arinsal,+Andorra/Pic+del+Port+Vell/@42.5719302,1.4512174,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x12af5fa4fd8cf1a5:0x92c1e92956a49e58!2m2!1d1.4818459!2d42.5748011!1m5!1m1!1s0x12af58ce0359dc37:0xfd81b0dced22d417!2m2!1d1.4380718!2d42.5710834!3e2) right at the border to Spain. Fortunately, I could bargain him down to just do half of the tour and enjoy the epic view from the chairlift station. Thankfully we had a night with almost no clouds so I could experiment a little bit with my phone's exposure settings.

After a break at the station, we decided to walk down as fast as we could to finally eat dinner.   
_(Please note that nearly every bar in Spain also serves food and they usually don't eat dinner until 8 PM)_  
For that, we chose [Cisco's Funky Bar & Restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.de/Restaurant_Review-g190393-d3737744-Reviews-Cisco_s_Funky_Bar_Restaurant-Arinsal_La_Massana_Parish.html) one of the best-voted bars in Andorra near our hostel.  We there enjoyed some food, Daiquiri's and then we got a little too confident and ordered something we never tried. Ben got a Bloody Mary and I tried a Firecracker (which I honestly just tried because the name sounded cool). At this point, I can tell you to never choose a drink based on the name! Apparently, a firecracker insists of some kind of lemon-chilli-tequila-salt mix and that tastes awful. Same thing for the Bloody Mary, literally just tomato juice with alcohol. Tastes awful. Besides our nasty cocktail experience, we overall were happy with the bar. We even got free shots at the end!

## Day 2:

The next day approached and we woke up early to still see a little bit more of Andorra. We enjoyed our free breakfast, checked out and were in La Vella before 9 AM. A miracle considering that I usually don't have to get up until 11 AM when I have to work.

We took the day pretty chilled and walked up a little hill where we could enjoy the view on the city and some of the mountains. We even found a cat walking around up there!

Rest of the day we just walked around the city centre and enjoyed the Christmas vibes.

At 3 PM my bus departed and my journey back home would normally take 2:30 hours, but as we didn't even get out of Andorra after 2 hours I realized that my journey would take a bit longer than expected. Instead of my expected one hour delay, the bus managed to need 6 hours for my whole journey.

I hope you could get a little insight of my short trip to Andorra. If you still want more read more, you might want to check out [Ben's blog](https://gerardjournaliste.wordpress.com/2018/12/15/up-lleida-andorra-tarrega-dos-semanas-passadas-explosivas/) and leave a nice comment from me!  
I hope to see you in my next post! <3
