This is it. 50 hours of pure programming, 100+ hours of researching new technologies and fixing bugs. After all this time with many annoying errors, I am finally able to present you my final product. 150+ hours of work. My portfolio-blog-mix.

From now on I can focus on writing many articles, reading all your comments (please comment it literally took me a whole day to figure out how to comment) and adding new technologies.

## What's next? 

Well, first of all, I want to need to deploy my blog to some kind of web hosting service. After talking with one of my old classmates he told me about [OVH](https://www.ovh.de/virtual_server/) and their extremely cheap VPS hosting.   
_VPS hosting means you get your own shared virtual machine on a server_

So that will be my next big problem.

After that, I planned to play a bit around with different types of WYSIWYG-Editors which allow advanced text input functions, such as bold and italic text etc. This would make commenting, under one of my posts much more enjoyable. I had [react-draft-wysiwg](https://github.com/jpuri/react-draft-wysiwyg) in my mind.

Next bullet point would be to connect my actual portfolio with the CMS. I just didn't want to do that until now and I don't feel like that has the highest priority to me, because it's like a one hour job or so.

And the last point on my bucket list would be to program. After all, what is a portfolio without projects to present? Whilst building this blog I stumbled upon some super cool videos about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning so I guess that's the next big project I'm aiming at. Watch the video below for an idea what cool things you can do with AI!

I guess that is it... for now. I hope we will meet in one of my next blogposts again!  
See you next time! <3
