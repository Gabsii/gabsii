Hello World!

This is my legitimate first blog post. I built the whole site your on right now my own. (Nerd-Alert: Front-End runs on React and Back-End is powered by Wordpress).

I want to use this blog as a kind of diary for my EVS experience in Manresa, Spain. (Hopefully I will keep posting stuff on here) At the moment of this blog post I am almost finished with building my whole page, thinking about how to deploy it and searching for possible vendors, thinking about a design for my 'About' section of the homepage and how to fill the 'Projects' tab.

Anyways, I thank everyone for reading until now and I hope to see you again on my blog. Many, many kudos to you <3

Bye bye, or as I learnt from my soon-to-be-roomate Joe:   
¡Os veré pronto!
