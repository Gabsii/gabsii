It's been over a year since I started this blog. With just one purpose in mind, informing my peers in Austria how my year abroad is going. Now I've been back for about 3 months and I was wondering what to do with this blog.

## 404 days ago

A quite fitting date to write this. 404 days since I left Austria for Spain. 404 days since I became more independent. 404 days since I was lost, alone and since I found myself in some uncomfortable situations. I am ridiculed by the coincidence this number serves to me today. Wikipedia defines HTTP 404 as follows:

> **HTTP 404 - Not found  
> **The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.
>
> Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#404)

And partially this is how I felt for quite some time in Spain. I knew I was gone for my friends and family but at the same time I was aware that I would soon return and spend as much of my time with them as possible.

What you don't see while being away from home is how much new stuff you learn. You start looking at life in a completely different way and you learn that failing is part of life, that you don't have to get along with everybody but you should stick to those who you get along with. The amount of independence I felt and the strong will to achieve a goal that I can be proud of now. That kept me going.

## Futureâ€½

_That, by the way, is an interrobang, the (in my opinion) coolest written character._

But back to the topic. The future. My future.

My current plans are to stay where I am. I want to cherish the time I have with my friends and family. At the moment I don't see much sense in forcing myself to visit a university. For now, all I want to do is to work and gain some experience and focus on my friends.

But Gabsi, what about your blog?

Good question my friend. Since I am back in Austria and working at a fulltime job I won't have that much time to travel around like when I was doing my EVS. So after thinking about it for quite a while I came to the conclusion to make this blog about stuff that I like. Which in that case means this blog may turn into a heavy technology-focused blog but **don't be scared, my non-techies**! I will continue to keep you up to date with my trips and I plan on posting some more personal stuff that fascinates me at the time.

I continuously try to improve myself in some way and the same goes for my blog and my projects. So don't shy away, I hope to see you in the future! :-)
