Semana Santa - or as we others refer to it - Easter holidays. Born as a joke, I made at the beginning of my EVS, when people asked me where I wanted to go, Joe and I decided to actually take a jump into the unknown lands of southern France. And by unknown lands of southern France, I mean ALL of southern France, but due to the fact that our budget and time (s/o to my boss who gives me fewer holidays than I should get) were limited, we cut down our journey to the capital of Occitania.

_10 PM - Barcelona (bus station)._ We started our adventure on Friday. Right after work (and a visit to the hairdresser for me), we packed our stuff and made our way to the main bus station in Barcelona - Estacio de Nord. Due to the incredibly great public transport system, we then had 40 minutes spare at the bus station before our bus would arrive. RENFE (Spanish train line) schedules are as infrequent as Germany's trains are punctual. 22:45 we set off for a 6-hour bus drive into the heart of the Occitanie.

## Saturday

### Arrival

_5 AM - Toulouse (bus station)._ Completely devastated from the worst 6h on a bus I ever faced - thanks for that Flixbus and girl who decided to kick her seat against my knee during the whole journey - we arrived at about 5 AM at the main bus station in Toulouse. Unfortunately, the bus station was located in the north of Toulouse and our Airbnb was located at the very south of the city. Even more unfortunate was the fact that public transport only starts between 6 and 7 AM. The peak of all unfortunateness is that the earliest time our host could meet us was 10 AM.

So still exhausted from the bus we first decided to slowly walk our way towards our hostel. Our journey down there took us about an hour and when we finally arrived at the place we decided to look for a cafe nearby to just warm ourselves up with some nice, warm tea.

After two awfully boring hours in the cafe, we went to meet our host, got the keys and immediately fell asleep.

### Sightseeing

_3 PM - Toulouse (house)._ Recharged from the 5h nap we just took, we decided to still make something out of the day and check out the city's centre. So we packed up some stuff and tried to figure out how we could get there. After checking multiple ways to reach the interesting part of the town, we decided to walk towards the southern train station of Toulouse and take the train back to the north because all the good stuff was up there.

_4 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ We arrived at the train station and headed towards the centre. Everything seems fine.

_4:15 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ There is some smoke in the far distance and you can hear some people shouting. Maybe something happened?

_4:20 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ Huge masses are walking towards the smoke... What is happening?

_4:22 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ Is the crowd producing that much smoke?

_4:23 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ All of the crowd's members are wearing those yellow vests you have in the car.

Gilets Jaunes

_4:24 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ Woah some guy just kicked in the window of a storefront and some other guys knocked a dumpster over! We better take a different route, those guys seem upset.

_4:25 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ Good thing we walked a different direction. Now we can finally enjoy the city.

_4:30 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ So we just crossed down this street and end up RIGHT IN FRONT OF A DAMN TANK THAT SHOOTS OUT TEAR GAS BOMBS??

_4:35 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ After 5 minutes of sheer amazement about the things, we are witnessing we decide to better keep going. But the only way to get to the old part of town was by crossing the huge street that was crowded by Gilets Jaunes protestors or walking 30 minutes around that thing.

_4:36 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ Sure thing we decided to cross. I would rather endanger my life than walking 30 minutes without a point.

_4:45 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ Well... maybe that was not the best idea. As soon as we came closer to the crowd we already got screamed at in French to 'Avance!' back to where we came from. It didn't take us long to understand that the police shot another round of tear gas bombs into the crowd we were close to and the people were (in tears) trying to get out of that mess. Thankfully we were far enough away to only get exposed to so much.

_5 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ 12 hours in Toulouse and we've almost been in a war. What an adventurous trip! Rest of the day was just strolling around the centre, taking pictures and eating probably one of the best burgers in Toulouse!

_8 PM - Toulouse (centre)_. Nurtured and already a bit tired we prepare ourselves to get back home. Assuming that the manifestation ended, we are walking towards the same place just to get a look at the aftermath there.

_8:25 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ We arrived. The protest is still going. And we want to see more.

_8:30 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ We somehow ended up pretty close to the fronts of the protest. No sign of tear gas or anything. All we saw up until now was five policemen charging into one innocent-looking guy for no apparent reason and then dragging him across the floor as if he was an animal whilst ripping his face mask off.

_8:35 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ The situation is starting to run out of control now. The police started to cut down some of the escape ways and they are about to close the distance between them and the protestors.

_8:36 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ The situation IS out of control now! People in front of us got hit by the police using batons just for wearing breathing masks. The policemen are aggressively telling people to move backwards and disband.

_8:37 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ They are shooting! Not with weapons but tear gas! I lost track of Joe but we somehow ended up fleeing in the same direction - away from the police - and regrouped in a side street. During my getaway, I saw some guy being pushed over from his bike and I assume someone stole it afterwards.

_8:40 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ A bit out of breath, we took a small break and reflected on what happened. But the police didn't stop we just caught some breath as the next round of tear gas bombs was fired.

_8:50 PM - Toulouse (centre)._ We fleed about 10 minutes away from the epicentre of the whole protest but can still smell and feel the tear gas being in the air.

_9:00 PM - Toulouse (train station)._ A bit shook we arrived at the train station just to realise that the last train just departed. So we yet again had to walk the way from north to south to get home and catch a good amount of sleep.

_10 PM - Toulouse (house)._ After we arrived at our house, we used some time to inform ourselves about the #GiletsJaunes and their actions.

## Sunday

_11 AM - Toulouse (house)._ After the events of yesterday, we decided to take today more relaxed and what is more relaxing than a museum. Luckily Toulouse is Europe's capital of flight sciences (from space shuttles over rockets to aeroplanes). But before the museum, we wanted to get some breakfast on the way.

_11:30 AM - Toulouse (market)_. What luck! On the way to the next metro station, we found a regional market. I used my rusty French skills to order Joe and myself Crepe and later to buy some olives as a snack for later.

### Cité de l'espace

_1 PM - Toulouse (Cité de l'espace)._ Took us some time (because we didn't find the right bus station) but we made it and the first impression was amazing! The museum had an indoor and an outdoor part with different stages and things to do. But from here on I will let my pictures tell the story:

The museum was extremely interesting and even interesting for the kids that wandered around there. The interactivity some of the galleries offered made the whole experience more interesting and better in general.

_6 PM - Toulouse (centre)_. After nearly 5 hours in the museum, we went back to the centre to eat and then went out to find a cool sunset spot. Which we were desperately searching for since [Comarruga](https://gabsii.com/blog/15-reasons-workshops-fail).

## Monday

### Aeroscopia

_11 AM - Toulouse (house)._ As already stated before. Toulouse titles itself as Europe's capital of flight sciences. Because of that we almost had to visit the Aeroscopia, a museum next to an Airbus factory.

_5 PM - Toulouse (Aeroscopia)_. In general, except for the part with the Concordia, I found the museum to be boring and only to visit if you are really interested in aeroplanes.

### Japanese Garden

_5 PM - Toulouse (Japanese Garden)._ As a relaxing finale, we visited the famous Japanese Garden of Toulouse. Not much to say except that it was really calming walking around little Japan.

_10 PM - Toulouse (house)_. After some beers in a fancy pub, we decided to head home and relax because tomorrow we would head back home to Manresa pretty early.

That's it for the trip. Sorry for my delayed post, I've been pretty busy with other stuff for the last few weeks. Thank you for reading and I still hope to see you in my next post! <3
