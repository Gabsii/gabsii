As my New Year's Resolution, I chose reading one book a month. Last month I read the book **The Secret** from _RhondaÂ Byrne_. An - I would say - Self-Help Literature Book. Throughout the book, you learn more and more about the so-called Secret that should help you get rich, have healthy relationships and even improve your personal health.

## Why did I read this book?

In 2017 I bought all my friends presents. None of them was prepared for it. About a month later Chinedu felt guilty and bought me a book to read in Spain (at that time he still thought it was a joke that I would go to Spain for 10 months - jokes on him). I usually don't read Self-Help Literature but in that case, the book caught my attention with the blurb:

> It has been passed down through the ages, highly coveted, hidden, lost, stolen, and bought for vast sums of money. This centuries-old Secret has been understoood by some of the most prominent people in history: Plato, Galileo, Beethoven, Edison, Carnegie, Einstein - along with other inventors, theologians, scientists, and great thinkers.
>
> Rhonda Byrne, The Secret (blurb)

The fact that some of the most inventive and interesting personalities in human history used the same technique to create/make some of the most groundbreaking technologies or inventions for their time and age sounded rather impressive to me.

## What is The Secret?

Throughout the book, you learn more and more about what The Secret is, how The Secret is constructed and how you can use The Secret yourself!

The book relies on the thesis that _The Sec_ret is as essential as the law of gravity, meaning the law can't just simply be turned off! Rhonda Byrne herself also sometimes refers to \_The Secret_ as the law of attraction in this book and that law is responsible for your thoughts and how they behave. In other words, everything you think will be attracted to you!

Everything you think, everything you say and everything you do, steers you into a certain direction and everything bad that happens to you happens for a reason - the reason being you thinking negative thoughts. You are a human transmission tower. You are sending frequencies to the universe with your thoughts. Your current thoughts create your future reality!  
Your thoughts become reality!

So you might start asking yourself how can I control those frequencies and make my life get better? Well, first of all, start controlling your thoughts. It is impossible to feel good, have a happy life and live your dream if you constantly feel bad, have bad thoughts and only see the worst in your life. Remember, every thought you think is sent to the universe and the universe will give you what you think! Therefore the only option you have is feeling good. (Implying that you want a happy and good life)

You can shift your feelings through the easiest things. Think happy thoughts. Listen to music that makes you feel good. Go out into nature (if that makes you happy). Talk to people you trust and love and just live in the moment because love is the highest frequency you can emit. The more love you feel and emit the greater the power you harness.

### How do I use The Secret?

I hope you saw _Aladin_ as a child because the law of attraction works the same way the Genie does. You ask - the law of attraction gives. Even unconscious decisions are sent to the universe.

The Creative Process of The Secret insists on three simple steps. Ask, Believe and Receive.

#### 1\. Ask

Clear your mind. Be completely free and just focus on what you want. If you don't know what you want at the moment just take a moment to find out what you want. After that just be completely free and think about nothing else for some minutes. A way to focus yourself on the things you want to achieve is if you write down the thing you want. While you ask the universe, be sure you focus your thoughts on positive things, e.g., if you want to lose money, don't focus on losing weight. Instead, focus on having a perfect weight. Negative thoughts just drag you down and the universe reads "I don't want to be fat" as " I want to be fat". Use positive ways to express your weight loss like "I want to have the perfect weight" and internalize this.

#### 2\. Believe

Believing involves acting, speaking and thinking so you might as well just start to act like have the thing you want. Feel healthy, rich or thin. Don't forget that you still receive everything you think so you have to genuinely think that you already achieved what you wanted.

#### 3\. Receive

Once you manifested your belief, you start to receive. Feel good so you get on the right frequency for receiving. And once you received what you wanted, be thankful. Thank everyone and everything. Just stop sometimes and get clear about how you feel currently and be happy about the good things that happened to you recently.

The rest of the book just insists on how to reach certain goals like getting rich, healthy, etc. And gives you real-life examples with people who achieved their goals just by using The Secret

## Reflection

The book and the story are obviously pointed to gullible people. The easier you believe something the more you will get involved in the story and The so-called Secret.

It exploits them by trying to use easy words, keep them interested in the book with some incredible stories (like the one time someone used The Secret and relieved from a full body paralysis). The book is pointed to people who are currently lost and don't know what to do in my opinion.

But that is nothing bad because the book spends some support and helps you to get through rough times. It lets you hope for better things and ignore bad things. Most of the time you don't have to think about the bad things that happened in the past. It's often just better to focus on good things and how you currently feel than to be stuck in the past.

Thank you for reading this post and I hope that I could inspire some you to read more and maybe even read this particular book! If you are interested let me know and I will send you my version of the book.  
See you in my next post! <3
