#**FYA**

Fuck Your Acronyms!

This week I attended MagnoliaJS, a developer conference usually hosted in Mississippi. That went on about multiple interesting topics like Artificial Intelligence, Accessibility, "Twitter Driven Development" and much more.

_Whilst attending the conference I worked on some personal side projects I may be able to launch this or the following week._

And during some of the talks, I recognized that speakers tend to use acronyms all the time for almost everything.

- APE - Act, Pour, Effect
- POUR - .... (already forgot what it means)
- etc.

And now that I am thinking about it further, acronyms have just become way too common in current times.  
API, REST, LOL, SOAP, WTF, ROFL, FYI, most of them are fairly common to everyday use (depending on who you are).

But it still doesnâ€™t justify using them in every situation, especially if you are publicly presenting a certain topic to a very broad audience with different levels of experience in a field.

Ironically I recognized this pattern in a talk from a guy about Accessibility and that Web Developers should not exclude others by their actions (e.g. disabling zoom).

This post was nothing more than just a quick rant that you should stay true to your own principles instead of being a preacher. _(if you read this Chris DeMars I really liked your talk, it was just something that bothered me in general)_

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk!
