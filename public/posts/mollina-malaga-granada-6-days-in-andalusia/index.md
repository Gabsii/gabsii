As EVS volunteers about halfway through our projects, we get to go to a so called "midterm evaluation" - a huge event bringing together other EVS volunteers from all around Spain to learn, think about our projects and to improve in the future. Mine was in a small village near Malaga, called Mollina, and it was absolutely fantastic. Great people, lots of energy and a ton of motivation for the future!

## Monday

### Leaving/Travelling

I've never been a friend of getting up early. Leaving Manresa at 6:30 AM didn't make the whole thing better for me, even if it meant leaving this shabby place. After my alarm painfully rang at 5:30 AM I got up, packed my last few items and accompanied by Anna and Joe made my way to the RENFE station in Manresa. After 1.5 hours of traveling by train, we arrived in Barcelona Sants where the high-speed train station is located.

There we had to pass through an airport-like security to get to our train. Needless to say, I was ready for an intense six-hour train ride to Antequera-Santa Ana through the middle of Spain with great scenery and landscapes.

Around 2 PM we finally made it to the train station in the middle of nowhere. Literally the middle of nowhere.

Initially, our ticket back to Barcelona was on Friday morning around 8:30 AM but a long time ago Joe and I had already planned to stay in the south of Spain a little bit longer to enjoy the Arabic-Spanish culture. Unfortunately, our train tickets were not flexible so as soon as we came out of the Information Center at the train station we booked a cheap flight with RyanAir from Malaga to Barcelona on Sunday morning.

After we booked the ticket we decided to walk around the farmland that was right in front of us with Camille, a girl we got to know during the [last formation back in Comarruga](https://gabsii.com/blog/15-reasons-workshops-fail/). After some scouting around in the woods we decided to return to the train station to wait for our bus to Mollina.

### Arrival

On time - for Spanish measurements - our bus to the mid-term training arrived. 20 minutes later we arrived in the CEULAJ, a seminar hostel especially constructed for events such as our formation. Shortly after arriving, the formation's organizer held a quick introduction speech and then took some photos of us after giving us the room keys.

Not being here for a long time had Joe and Me on the edge to go outside and walk around Mollina. On our way outside we met another volunteer called Lennard who wanted to accompany us. Driven by the same vision - seeing the stunning mountain range - we made our way to the outskirts of the village and, despite 28°C and burning hot sun, had the great view we expected!

![Great mountain range outside of Mollina](images/mollina-1024x768.jpg)

Sadly but thankful for the great view we returned back to the hostel to meet some new people before the dinner would start. After dinner, we played classic introduction games with all of the roughly 90 volunteers. Later we split into four different groups. The game was an old friend of mine... "Write down three facts about yourself of which one fact is a lie", loyal readers may already know how my relationship with this game is and therefore can guess how I felt.

Annoyed by the games of the introduction, me and some guys I met before dinner and during the introduction decided to search for a bar to drink some beer.

## Tuesday

### Morning

A bit tired but overall in a good mood - although lacking motivation for the workshops - did I wake up with an immediate excuse to my roommate Maicol \[pronounced Michael, engl.\] because I feared that I was a bit too loud while I returned home after one too many beers at the bar. Fortunately, Maicol has a deep sleep and didn't wake up when I struggled to make it to my bed.

After a good, healthy breakfast I started into the workshop. The first topic we wanted to talk about in my group (Grupo Verde!) was our projects. Each had to present himself and explain to the others what he or she is currently doing. This was nice to get to know some of the people but to be fair, I already forgot most of the projects by the time we went for dinner.

### Afternoon

Saturated after the dinner, I met up with volunteers from other groups, got some blankets and went for a siesta in the sun. The siesta then somehow turned into a discussion circle about politics, Europe and more. Still refreshing! Later we did one of my beloved energizers... but despite the bad history I have with them, this one was just perfect for me: "Rock, Paper, Scissors", the game I played almost every day in my project for the last 6 months. I became a real "Rock, Paper, Scissors" - professional during that time. I was unstoppable; until a girl in my team didn't know when to show her hand figure. It was a devastating loss for us and my Scissors-only strategy. Completely destroyed I then tried to look as good as possible for the group picture.

Afterwards, we had another block of workshop stuff I honestly don't remember (seriously I don't have any clue what we did). But then we kicked off the open space for personal questions considering our project. If any questions or serious problems came up during the first few workshops we could ask them there in a 1-on-1 session with your coach. The task for all the others was preparing the presentation for our Communidad (Spanish equivalent to "Bundesland").

![Llibertat! Presos Politics!](images/cultural-noche.jpg)

Llibertat! Presos Politics!

It was a fun evening during which I could finally assign some of the faces to an approximate location in Spain and even learn some stuff about their Communidad. You might already know what happened after everyone presented their county. Yes, it was bar time!

## Wednesday

Wednesday was solely focussed on our learning progress. We started by writing down different things we learnt during our EVS, the next task was to assign them to one of the seven categories for the YouthPass.

- Communication in the mother tongue
  - ... why? In a normal case, I would never have to use my mother tongue during my EVS
- Communication in a foreign languages
  - Oh hell nah, my Spanish is bad. But my English somehow improved. And my Catalan is somewhat decent.
- Mathematical Competence and basic competencies in Science and Technology
  - Fancy for "Problem Solving"
- Digital Competence
  - How and what online resources did I use during my EVS
- Learning to learn
  - Basically, everything they told us in Comarruga
- Social and Civic Competencies
  - Conflict Management, Interactions with the Community, Teamwork, ... (all the buzzword stuff)
- Sense of Initiative and Entrepreneurship
  - Personal development mostly
- Cultural Awareness and Expression
  - Cultural shocks and similarities

If you thought I remembered all of this stuff you are completely wrong, I was probably sleeping or something when they talked about that stuff because I had to look up all of this just now.

### Malaga

For half a day, we headed to Malaga, to chill out and explore the city. Initially they gave us a task to raise awareness for the EVS program but as soon as anyone saw the tasks we had to fulfil, only the try-hards and overcommitted ones really cared about doing so. I almost immediately lost my group and joined some Georgian girls to explore the beauty of Malaga.

![georgians and me](images/georgians-and-me-1024x821.jpg)

Immediately after groups were disbanded we made our way to the "Parque de Málaga" which was next to a sweet alley where we got a glimpse on the "Ayuntamiento".

After buying some post cards, we made our way to the cathedral and from there to the old part of town. I really enjoyed just walking around the streets because they were so clean and looked so good. Manresa's streets tend to drag my mood down.

Perfectly in time for sunset we walked towards the port and then continued to the beach to eat dinner. Saturated by the dinner (...not; - seriously not even I feel full after a sandwich and some fruits) the girls wanted to go to one of their favourite shops - AleHop. Personally, I thought that was a girls shop but my prejudices got disproven pretty fast. I enjoyed walking around in there because they had all these cute and funny petite things to sell. I even got myself some stuff for tea brewing!

In time - in Spanish measurements - our bus departed back to Mollina. And yes, you already know where we went after the official program. Back to bed because we were all tired. Not everyone can stay up every night until 4 AM dancing and drinking in a small bar! We are just humans after all.

## Thursday

Thursday marked the end of our formation and everyone would agree that the end came way too fast.

Today's program was mostly about identifying difficulties, solving them, motivating ourselves for the end and setting some goals for the coming months. In between, we had a really strange motivational meditation where I got scared that the workshop turns to a Comarruga disaster again.

![Meditation matting... my greatest foe!](images/meditation-e1553395070864-1024x966.jpg)

The following task was to prepare a poster with some questions about the formation and what we want to do after our EVS. I professionally dodged doing anything by acting as if I was contributing whilst just talking to Noémi all the time.

### Noche "Autogestionada"

This night's program was planned by a committee of two self-assigned organisers per group. What they planned to do was a Gymkhana/Scavenger Hunt/Treasure Hunt/Schnitzeljagd. Call it what you want, it failed anyways. The idea was great - the execution wasn't.

They printed out QR-Codes to play the game. One person of every group had to scan the code which was a disguise for an invitation to a WhatsApp group. Everytime you scanned a code you got yourself into a new group with a new riddle to solve on the campus. As I said, great idea. The big problem - and probably the point where everything failed - was the actual scanning of the QR codes and the system behind the groups. Seriously have you ever seen someone scanning a QR code? People really get overwhelmed with that stuff and it doesn't work most of the time because the light is missing or the internet connection is bad. (Does someone around here know [PicturesOfPeopleScanningQRCodes](http://picturesofpeoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com/)? Great blog!)

![bar](images/bar-1024x768.jpg)

After a good hour of failing and a wave of disappointment, the committee decided to stop the game and lead everyone to the bar. For the last time. The night was packed with people trying to hook up, Antoni inviting everyone for chupitos (shots) and loads of beers. I for my part wanted to take the night slow and just sat down at the bar with a beer and talked with Noémi for the rest of the night. We eventually made it back to the hostel around 5 AM.

## Friday

After arriving at home yesterday at 5 AM it was really hard to catch the bus at 9:30 to Malaga. As mentioned before Joe and I booked plane tickets from Malaga to Barcelona for Sunday but we had no particular plan what to do until Thursday. We wanted to see Granada.

But keeping up our spontaneity we had no clue how to get from Malaga to Granada so we did what everybody else seemed to do and just walked to the train station where the RENFE personnel told us to please search for the bus station next doors. And they actually had buses to Granada. We booked them and arrived there - kinda hungover - about two hours later.

### Granada

How great I felt actually arriving there after we basically had no plan on how to get there. Some of you might ask yourself now:

> "But wait if you're so spontaneous, how did you get a cheap hostel then???"
>
> You all, right now

Weeeell. We actually didn't. Remember four paragraphs above where I was talking with Noémi? She happens to be a volunteer in Maracena - a small village directly next to Granada. I didn't hesitate in the bar and used all my charm to beg on my knees for a place to stay for one night. A big shoutout to her for hosting us!

#### Miradors

But before we went to her place, Joe and I wanted to get an overview of Granada. And because I became a huge fan of walking during my project I rushed a hungover-Joe through the streets of Granada over hills from mirador (lookout) to mirador. The views were amazing!

#### Park Alhambra

After basically seeing every major mirador around, we wanted to see the trademark of Granada. La Alhambra. Hiking down one hill, climbing up another and there we were. Right in front of it! Just to see that all tickets had been sold out and there was no way for us to enter. Downcasted we then went on to one of the many parks around the Alhambra and despite not being able to enter the Alhambra we still enjoyed walking up there just for the gardens!

Finally, we were exhausted enough to look for Noémi's flat where she was already waiting for us. She and her flatmates went to a farewell party shortly after we got comfortable with the place (THEY HAD A WOODEN FLOOR! A pure fortune!). Before they left the flat they informed us about the broken TV and since we were here anyway without anything to do, I wanted to show my gratitude by fixing their TV. Surprised by myself it actually worked and is still working to that moment.

## Saturday

### Granada

Noémi told me about the great sunrise you can experience from their balcony. So I set my alarm pretty early that day just to get up, go outside to sit on the balcony for the sunrise for some minutes.

Because she was partying until 4 AM at the farewell party, Noémi slept until around 2 PM. Therefore Joe and I decided to make a lazy morning. We slept, read and watched TV until Noémi was up because she wanted to show us around the town.

After we saw the great city centre and some other places we went for a secret mirador where we wanted to meet up with another volunteer we met during the formation to watch the sun set.

After the sun finally set we hurried to reach the bus station, which we failed to do in time. With the knowledge that we just missed our last bus, we just went ahead and booked a BlaBlaCar from Granada to Malaga. I really liked travelling with that, not just because you get to know some locals and have the opportunity talk, but also because it is faster and way cheaper than the bus.

Because we arrived late in Malaga, we were too lazy and unstructured. We just preferred to book a cheap hostel instead of bothering other volunteers. We stayed at the [Feel Hostels Soho](https://www.booking.com/s/52_6/84234b71) in Malaga,  
all in all the hostel was a good one for the price we paid but one of the guys next to me was snoring all night which made it really hard for me to fall asleep and then to stay asleep.

## Sunday

Exhausted, tired and in a bad mood I got up early again - Wow, this week was marked with early mornings- because we had to catch the flight at the airport. We quickly made it to the bus station where we got the airport bus and then made it through the security check without any further delay directly to the gate.

![Not even back since 2 hours and I am already heating up some discussions again!](images/trouble-as-catalac-819x1024.jpg)

After about an hour on the plane, we arrived in Barcelona. A bit depressed by the weather there and the thought that we might not see some of the people ever again, Joe and I decided to stay in Barcelona for a while just to not return back home and ending this dream of a week we had.

We walked around Parc de Montjuic for some time but decided to grab some food shortly after because we had nothing to eat all day. After a good meal at [Happy Rock](http://www.happy.es/restaurante/happy-rock/) we decided to take the train back home.

![Montserrat - my next goal?](images/train-home-e1553396478983-768x1024.jpg)

Montserrat - my next goal?

## Conclusion

Before this week started I really did not want to go to the mid-term training. My hate against the EVS system and the senseless system behind all of it made me angry and didn't let me enjoy my time here. Now after the week finished I can gladly announce that I found some motivation again to finish my last 4 months out there. This week I even found the balls to finally step up and tell my mentor that I didn't like my current project and the fact that I basically stick to Anna all the time. Not shortly after we got separated and I can already feel a huge shift in my mood!

I am glad for anyone who read until this point and I hope I could bring you my experience here a bit closer.  
See you in my next post <3
