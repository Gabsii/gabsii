Ben aka Benoit - a guy I only knew for three weeks or so at that point asked Joe and me to go to Mallorca in early November. Crazy as we are we told him we would join him. We went on this adventure last week and I used my only holidays for it but it was definitely worth a visit! Especially if you consider that I got the flight (both directions) for 20€.

## Saturday | Arrival

Joe and I started our trip from Manresa at 8 AM with the Catalan train to Europa | Fira where we then changed to the Metro. Measured from Manresa this did cost us already 11€ (they charge you 5€ just to enter the Airport Metro). At the Airport we met a slightly delayed Ben, who looked still pretty drowsy. At 11:05 we sat on the plane and were ready to start our adventure!

The flight was a little delayed but we still managed to be on Palma de Mallorca within 30 minutes after departing.

The first thing we did was getting our rented car because we planned on seeing more than just Palma and our friends and co-workers told us that we would be way better off if we booked a car instead of relying on public transport whilst on the island.  
Fully equipped with our new car we drove to our Hotel in Palma where we immediately were greeted by two nice receptionists.

After checking in and putting our stuff in the room we decided to walk around the town to search a place to grab some food. We decided to go to the Columbian restaurant down the street where I tried Patacon con todo and Enchiladas for the first time.

Fully nurtured we went on to see the church we saw from the car and we ended up taking some beautiful pictures on the way and there.

We ended our day by sitting in one of the local bars called Cafe Tropical where we just sat and told us stories as the finale of the day.

## Sunday | The North

Sunday, our probably most productive day! We started our day at around 9 AM with the goal to reach the Cap de Formentor around sunset!

### Raixa

The first stop on our list. Navigated by our co-driver Ben who was equipped with his Tablet and the [Mallorca RunAway App](http://mallorcarunaway.com/de/) we stopped pretty early at Raixa. Raixa was a small countryside where Arabs had their famous gardens. Sadly the gardens were closed so we just managed to get some shots of the buildings and gardens by crossing a small fence. Unfortunately we couldn't continue our illegal adventure because we got called off immediately after trespassing.

### Sóller

Recommended by one of Joe's co-workers we visited the small town near the coast to see some the famous tram that takes you from Sóller to Palma and vice versa.

### Port de Sóller

Our thirst for a beach reached highs so we decided to drive to the Port which was 15min away from Sóller. As we arrived there we couldn't believe our eyes. A beautiful small beach in a bay with a gorgeous look on some cliffs. I took to opportunity to once again trespass and ask Joe for a picture of me.

### Fornalutx

After this beautiful view, we got hungry and decided to try our best in a small village in the middle of the mountains. After trying to find a parking lot for 10 minutes we sat at a small cafe pretty much in the center and had some lunch.

### Mountains, Lakes and more...

Nurtured from good food we continued our way to the Cap de Formentor right through the mountains. (The road reminded me of [the one scene in Cars](https://youtu.be/WYhE4K9SDGI?t=20) for a moment to be fair).

### Port de Pollenca

Beautiful Port in a bay with a view to Alcúdia.

### Cap de Formentor

Finally, we arrived. After an almost 6h long journey - yes, the stops were long - we managed to see the stunning view of the Cap de Formentor at the most Northern place on Palma de Mallorca.

I also managed to improve some of my long time exposure skills and got some incredibly stunning pictures of the night sky.

### Back in Palma

Back in Palma, we met Ben's French friends Thoma, Florian and Agathe. Because Ben's birthday was tomorrow we then decided to go clubbing at a small place where a self-called Ex-Basketball player and Ex-Head Coach of the Manchester Giants lured us into his new freshly opened night club.

## Monday | The West

Today's goal: Explore the west and maybe get a look on the mysterious island Sa Dragonera. But because most of us were still tired from the clubbing we left at around 12 PM.

### Andratx

First stop for today: Andratx. Beautiful beach with beautiful scenery.

### Port d'Andratx

Although we didn't spend that much time at the port we still saw some incredible places and, once again, I had the opportunity to trespass. This time by climbing up a 5m high wall to a tower.

- ![](images/P_20190128_154522_vHDR_Auto_HP-1024x576.jpg)

We gathered the food we got from a supermarket before and decided to sit in a sheltered place near the coast to eat and rest and dodge some of the wind.

### Sant Elm

Close before sunset, we arrived to get an unbelievable view on the island Sa Dragonera.

## Tuesday | The South

Today we started a bit earlier but due to the bad looking windy grey weather, our motivation reached a low. We still drove to the South because we wanted to see the famous Caves de Drac (SPOILER: we never got to actually see them).

### Cap de Pera

Definitely the most adventurous part of the journey. Here I almost lost my phone, fell down cliffs and had to fight my way through a forest to find the way back to the car! Cap de Pera.

### Cap Vermell

After this adventure we grabbed the food and again enjoyed a meal at the coastline!

## Wednesday | Departure

Every great journey ends somewhere. We all knew that so and to celebrate the great time we invited one of the receptionists who really helped us to come with us and grab breakfast in the morning.

After the breakfast, we rushed back to the hostel to check out and get the car back to the rental station and proceeded our way back home.
